 * ### The Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use
 *
 * UN M49 or the Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (Series M, No. 49) is a standard for area codes
 * used by the United Nations for statistical purposes, developed and maintained
 * by the United Nations Statistics Division. Each area code is a 3-digit number that can refer to a wide variety
 * of geographical and political regions, like a continent and a country.
 * Codes assigned in the system generally aren't changed when the country or area's name changes (unlike ISO 3166-1
 * alpha-2 or ISO 3166-1 alpha-3). But instead change when the territorial extent of the country or area changes
 * significantly, although there have been exceptions to this rule.
 * @since 1.0.0
